  <li><b>Choosing an AMI for R</b></li>
  First and foremost, you need to launch an EC2 instance and to do that, you have to choose an AMI, In this tutorial, we'll be using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/">Amazon Linux AMI</a> since it has a stable version of R in its repository.
  NB: Starting a server on AWSâ€”called an EC2 instance to know more about how to go about launching an instance <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">click here<a>
  <li><b>Choosing an Insatance type for R</b></li>
  Choose an EC2 instance type that matches the data size and processing that your analysis requires. By default, R runs only on one core node and, in many cases, requires a lot of memory.

For programming and development, the general-purpose T2 instance types are sufficient and cheap, and t2.micro is available through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Tier.<a><br>
